**How would you contribute back to the club?**\
I will help the people to learn things which I know . I like teaching others the knowledge I know. I will also learn things from them.\
**4.Do you have any feedback for the selction process?**\
I liked the selection process very much, Before tasks were given I have zero knowledge about coding .
After seeing the tasks I was afraid that I knew nothing about them.
I started slow with watching CS50 and started doing other tasks .
I searched for every task in google and learnt the purpose of task, the knowledge I need to do them, and learned them, I didn't all the tasks 
but the tasks I completed , I did with my best. I learned many things while doing the tasks.I struggled to do some tasks but the tasks were well picked.
All I wanted to say is that tasks for selection process are awesome.
