First I tried using the online complier. After debugging few errors in the code, it showed the exception 'No X11 DISPLAY variable was set, but this program performed an operation which requires it.'
I understood that it has something to do with the online complier and I was adviced to run the code on local machine.
Then I installed JDK on local system then code has run successfully.
